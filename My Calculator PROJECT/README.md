# Simple Calculator 

This is a basic calculator project made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It can perform simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division and a few more.  
This is my first web development project.  
I built it to practice and learn the basics of front-end development.  
Feel free to try it out or improve it!
